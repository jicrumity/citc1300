        <p>
            Another significant figure in Batman's romantic history is Vicki Vale, a photojournalist who represents a more traditional love interest. Their relationship brings out a different side of Bruce Wayne, one that is more publicly visible and less shadowed by his alter ego. Vicki’s role in his life is often marked by a struggle to balance his dual identities, with her eventual departure typically due to the challenges of living with someone who is both a high-profile billionaire and a secretive vigilante.
