    <h1> Batman Begins</h1>
    <p>
        A young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri
        Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. When Ducard reveals the League's true
        purpose -- the complete destruction of Gotham City -- Wayne returns to Gotham intent on cleaning up the city
        without resorting to murder. With the help of Alfred (Michael Caine), his loyal butler, and Lucius Fox (Morgan
        Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.

    <h2>The Dark Knight </h2>
    <p>
        With the help of allies Lt. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and DA Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), Batman (Christian Bale)
        has been able to keep a tight lid on crime in Gotham City. But when a vile young criminal calling himself the
        Joker (Heath Ledger) suddenly throws the town into chaos, the caped Crusader begins to tread a fine line between
        heroism and vigilantism.</p>

    <h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>
        It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale), in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman),
        vanished into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed everything for
        what he and Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne
        Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may
        not be able to win.
