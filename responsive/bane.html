            <h1> Introdution to Bane</h1>
            <p>Bane, a notorious villain in the DC Comics universe, is one of Batman's most formidable adversaries.
                First appearing in "Batman: Vengeance of Bane" #1 in 1993, Bane was created by writer Chuck Dixon and
                artist Graham Nolan. His character is known for his immense physical strength, tactical genius, and
                complex backstory, making him a standout among Batman’s rogues' gallery.</p>
            <h2>Origins and Background</h2>
            <p>Bane was born in the fictional Caribbean island of Santa Prisca, in the notorious prison of Peña Duro.
                His father, Edmund Dorrance (also known as King Snake), was a revolutionary who sought to overthrow the
                corrupt government of Santa Prisca. When Dorrance was killed, Bane’s mother was imprisoned, and Bane
                himself was left in the harsh confines of Peña Duro. From a young age, Bane was subjected to the brutal
                environment of the prison, where he grew to be a physical powerhouse. His immense strength and intellect
                were further enhanced by his exposure to a drug called Venom, which significantly increased his physical
                capabilities. Venom, a powerful and addictive substance, became central to Bane's persona and his
                reputation as a formidable adversary.</p>
